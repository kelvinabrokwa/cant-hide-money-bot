## About the app

Currently, we store the portfolio as a big list of trades like:

```python
class Trade:
    symbol: Symbol
    dir_: Dir
    qty: Qty
    time: datetime
    price: float
    trader: Trader
    guild: str
```

An empty portfolio has 0 USD and no positions. When you do a BUY trade, you get shorter USD and longer the security.
When you do a SELL trade, you get longer USD and shorter the security. Note that we capture market prices at execution
time in Trade to be able to calculate the value of the portfolio later.
